# SpendSmart - Personal Expense Tracker 📱💰

**Group 2 | ICS 2300: Mobile Applications Design and Development**

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

**SpendSmart** is a modern Android application designed to help young adults and students take control of their financial health. Unlike basic calculators, SpendSmart provides a comprehensive **"Single Activity, Multi-Fragment"** experience that allows for seamless navigation between spending dashboards, data entry, and financial insights.

> **Our Goal:** To achieve a 20/20 score by implementing advanced UI/UX principles (Material Design 3) and robust local data persistence.

## 🔍 Problem Identification & Justification

### **The Problem**

Many individuals suffer from **"invisible spending"**—the accumulation of small, untracked daily expenses that lead to financial instability by the end of the month. Traditional banking apps often lack the granular, user-friendly categorization needed for proactive budgeting.

### **Justification**

Financial literacy is a critical life skill. By providing a tool that offers real-time visual feedback (color-coded progress bars and category breakdowns), SpendSmart solves the problem of financial unawareness, reducing anxiety and promoting better saving habits.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Intelligent Dashboard:** A high-level view of "Remaining Budget" with a dynamic progress bar that changes color (Green → Yellow → Red) as you approach your limit.
* **Streamlined Data Entry:** A user-centric form featuring DatePickers, category dropdowns, and a specialized **Lead's Reset Function** for rapid logging.
* **Visual Analytics:** Detailed category-wise spending breakdowns to help users identify where they are overspending.
* **Material 3 UI:** Built using elevated CardViews, outlined input fields, and a professional Bottom Navigation Bar.
